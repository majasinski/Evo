So far includes C#-coded nodes responsible for solving single-objective optimization problems using Genetic Algorithms (GA). The package is suitable for optimizing multi-variable number-based problems as well as combinatorial ones.\r\n\r\nFor more info see the specification and sample files in the extra folder.
